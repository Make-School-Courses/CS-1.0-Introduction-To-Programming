# Custom Calculator ðŸ§®

## Description
In this project we will write a Python program to create a text based calculator program similar to the calculators you built in class! This calculator will be based on a topic of your choosing, so be creative!

Feel free to use any calculation topic of your choice as long as it isn't one of the calculation programs we already wrote in class.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Document your code with comments and README's
1. Set up a basic github repo and commit
1. Apply the input() function to get user input
1. Apply the print() function to display output
1. Use variables and operations to perform calculations using a mathematical formulas

## Tool Setup:
Before starting this assignment, watch the following tutorials to configure Python and GitHub:

* Step 1: [Install Python 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj0PkjHYr0) (~3 minutes)
* Step 2: [Setup Python in Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YE7aEM3ZSQ) (~10 mins)
* Step 3: [Using File Explorer in Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3SIJwGgGtI) (~5 minutes)
* Step 4: [Navigating Files on a Mac](https://youtu.be/ux8yzFHoiDc) (~4 minutes)
* Step 5: [Learn Github](https://youtu.be/c3SfAP_PfaY) (~15 minutes)


## Assignment Set Up:
ðŸš¨  Before starting the assignment, watch [How to: Setup for a New Assignment](https://youtu.be/MCbDO8IpqZM). 

This tutorial walks your through how to set up a new repository, make commits, and push code to Github.


## Requirements

### Submission Requirements:
1. Your submitted code should be in a new (public) repo on Github.
1. Your respository should have a minimum of **3 commits**. 
1. Your repositroy should include a README with the name of your Calculator and a description.
1. Submit the link to your repo on Gradescope.
1. Create a demo video. The demo should include a walkthrough of your code and demonstration of how your bot working.

## Requirements

1. `print()` Welcome messaging for users welcoming them to your program and how it works.

1. Using `input()` statements, get at least two numerical values from the user to be used in your calculation.

1. Using the input values from the user, perform a calculation using a mathematical formula related to your topic.

1. `print()` out the results of the calculation to the user. Print a user friendly message, not just a value.

1. Comment your code. Comments should explain lines of code and how they are used in your calculations. 

1. The class session after this assignment is due we will have a show and tell so you can all show off what you created!


### Stretch Requirements/Challenges (Optional)
1. Modify your program to perform multiple calculations

## Rubric
