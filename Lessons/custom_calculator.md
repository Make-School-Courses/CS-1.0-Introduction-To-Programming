# Custom Calculator

## Description
In this project we will write a Python program to create a text based calculator program similar to the calculators you built in class! This calculator will be based on a topic of your choosing, so be creative!

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Document your code with comments and README's
1. Set up a basic github repo and commit
1. Apply the input() function to get user input
1. Apply the print() function to display output
1. Use variables and operations to perform calculations using a mathematical formulas

## Tool Setup:
Before starting this assignment, watch the following tutorials to configure Python and GitHub:

* Step 1: [Install Python 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frj0PkjHYr0) (~3 minutes)
* Step 2: [Setup Python in Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YE7aEM3ZSQ) (~10 mins)
* Step 3: [Using File Explorer in Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3SIJwGgGtI) (~5 minutes)
* Step 4: [Navigating Files on a Mac](https://youtu.be/ux8yzFHoiDc) (~4 minutes)
* Step 5: [Learn Github](https://youtu.be/c3SfAP_PfaY) (~15 minutes)

## Requirements

1. In the comments of your code explain what your calculation program does

1. In the README of your repo explain what your calculation program does (minimally include: name, description, programming language used (i.e. Python 3.7.9)

1. Get at least two numerical values from the user to be used in your calculation

1. Perform a calculation using a mathematical formula

1. Print out the results of the calculation to the user 

1. Your submitted code should be in a repo on Github and should have a minimum of 3 commits, you will need to submit the link to your repo on gradescope in order to receive a grade

1. Create a video demo of your calculator that walks through your completed code and shows your program running

1. Feel free to use any calculation topic of your choice as long as it isn't one of the calculation programs we already wrote in class.

1. The class session after this assignment is due we will have a show and tell so you can all show off what you created!



### Stretch Requirements/Challenges (Optional)
1. Modify your program to perform multiple calculations

## Rubric
This project will be graded using the [Custom Calculator Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166bAiDtTDGWUBanIiVO-FP1WER0i0930-YdSdwGwvT0/copy)
