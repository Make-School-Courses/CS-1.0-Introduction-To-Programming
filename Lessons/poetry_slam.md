# Poetry Slam

Due: October 1st at 11pm PDT <br/>
Assignment on Gradescope: [Here](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/154615/assignments/696326)

## Description
In this project we will write a Python program to print out poetry backwards, randomly, and any way you can rearrange!

By reading a poem in news ways we can discover new meanings or invite new interpretations.

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Implement functions
1. apply file input and output
1. Practice storing items in lists and reading from them
1. Implement loops
1. String manipulation and formatting
1. Apply the random module to your programs
1. Make connections to fields outside of CS

## Requirements

1. You will store your poem in a .txt file 

1. Your code should implement the get_file_lines() function. This function takes in a filename as a string and returns a list of strings containing the lines of the file.

1. Your code should implement the lines_printed_backwards() function. This function takes in a list of strings containing the lines of your poem as arguments and will print the poem lines out in reverse with the line numbers reversed. For example, if you poem is Remember by Joy Harjo:


Remember the sky that you were born under,\
know each of the star's stories.\
Remember the moon, know who she is.\
Remember the sun's birth at dawn, that is the\
strongest point of time. Remember sundown\
and the giving away to night.\
Remember your birth, how your mother struggled\
to give you form and breath. You are evidence of\
her life, and her mother's, and hers.\
Remember your father. He is your life, also.\
Remember the earth whose skin you are:\
red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth\
brown earth, we are earth.\
Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their\
tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,\
listen to them. They are alive poems.\
Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the
origin of this universe.\
Remember you are all people and all people
are you.\
Remember you are this universe and this
universe is you.\
Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.\
Remember language comes from this.\
Remember the dance language is, that life is.\
Remember.

then your function will print:

26 Remember.\
25 Remember the dance language is, that life is.\
24 Remember language comes from this.\
23 Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.\
22 universe is you.\
21 Remember you are this universe and this\
20 are you.\
19 Remember you are all people and all people\
18 origin of this universe.\
17 Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows the\
16 listen to them. They are alive poems.\
15 tribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,\
14 Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have their\
13 brown earth, we are earth.\
12 red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earth\
11 Remember the earth whose skin you are:\
10 Remember your father. He is your life, also.\
9 her life, and her mother's, and hers.\
8 to give you form and breath. You are evidence of\
7 Remember your birth, how your mother struggled\
6 and the giving away to night.\
5 strongest point of time. Remember sundown\
4 Remember the sun's birth at dawn, that is the\
3 Remember the moon, know who she is.\
2 know each of the star's stories.\
1 Remember the sky that you were born under,

1. Your code should implement the lines_printed_random() function which will randomly select lines from a list of strings and print them out in random order. **Repeats are okay** and the number of lines printed should be equal to the original number of lines in the poem (line numbers don't need to be printed). Hint: try using a loop and randint()

1. Your code should implement a function of your choice that rearranges the poem in a unique way, be creative! Make sure that you carefully comment your custom function so it's clear what it does.

1. Your final submitted code should use the four functions your wrote and print out the poem contained in your text file backwards, random, and custom. 

1. Your submitted code should be in a repo on Github and should have a minimum of 5 commits, you will need to submit the link to your repo on gradescope in order to receive a grade

1. Feel free to use any poem of your choice!

1. The class session after this assignment is due we will have an optional poetry reading in class!

### Stretch Requirements/Challenges (Optional)
1. Modify your program to have a menu that the user can select from rather than printing all the options at once
1. Modify your program to read the poem from user input
1. Modify your program to randomly rearrange the words on each line
