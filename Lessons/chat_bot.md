# Chat Bot

## Description
In this project we will write a Python program to create simple [chat bot](https://www.cleverbot.com/) using conditionals, lists, and loops. Your chat bot will be focused on a specific topic so think about what kinds of questions you want your chatbot to answer!

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Implement more advanced functions
1. Use conditionals and boolean logic to control prompts and responses
1. Use lists to store and manipulate responses
1. Use loops to check for valid input and traverse response options stored in lists

## Requirements

1. TBD 

1. Your submitted code should be in a repo on Github and should have a minimum of 5 commits, you will need to submit the link to your repo on gradescope in order to receive a grade

1. Feel free to use any chat bot topic of your choice, it could be a mood bot or a bot that wants to talk about video games, be creative!

1. The class session after this assignment is due we will have a show and tell session where we can all try each other's chat bots out!

### Stretch Requirements/Challenges (Optional)
1. Modify your program to interpret even more complex responses and answers

## Rubric
This project will be graded using the [Chat Bot Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFZo2KHTOTVk-uL0LL93MUgSey-wPQjTvSRsxPyTivw/copy)
